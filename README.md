"Hunting wolves."
In a forest of size N x N, four wolves and two hunters are moving chaotically at some speed.
When the coordinates of the wolf and the hunter coincide, the wolf disappears, and the hunter notifies the other hunter and the forestry about his prey.
If the wolf reaches the edge of the forest, he is saved.
The process of movement of wolves and hunters can be visualized on the display using pseudographic symbols (to study independently) or using Windows Forms.
