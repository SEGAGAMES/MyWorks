Task: to write a client application.
The client receives arithmetic examples from the server. Provides the user with 
the ability to enter a response. Sends a response to the server. According to the server's reaction to the sent
response, it can either congratulate the user, or suggest trying to enter
the answer to the same task again, or shows the answer if the user does not want to guess.
